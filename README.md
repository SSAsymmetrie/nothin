The 1920s was an unprecedented boom in art, technology, and entertainment. These advancements also gathered spirit for many minorities 
who were previously neglected. They found unifying symbols and opportunities that were available before. However, despite their newfound
hope, there were still doors that kept closing in front of them due to the broken system. Those who benefited from the 1920's cultural 
revolution included European women, African Americans, and homosexuals.

The 19th amendement had become ratidifed in 1920 which granted the right to vote. This victorty was supplemented by the supremem court 
ruling to overyurn minimum wage laws for women in Adkins v. Children's Hospital and legislation passed  the Sheppardâ€“Towner Act  
which granted funding for maternity and child care. White women became infatuated with consumerism of beauty, houtec and entertainment. 
This obsession forced more white women to find jobs to support the family and their addiction. 
They still only worked in limited jobs such as 
clerks and nursing, but a lot of them were less dangerous than factories. Many white women were popular actresses and the clothing became 
extravagant and artistic. White women tend to favor music that had romantic and sexual tones. Literature was also expanded by white women 
such as Edith Wharthon and Ellen Glasglow which touched on themes of morality and impersonality. However, white women wages were still 
half as men and property was owned by husband. Women still were discouraged to enter politic, so femenism had a long way to go 
but divorces helped greatly.

African Americans were moving up socially and economically. Many were getting rich even though many were also poor. The KKK and the red
scare continued to ravage their lives, but eventually legislation sought to deter these hate groups. The Maple Fllor Association case
protected Black miners from having their unions broken. They practiced their rights to vote and own land, but many southerners set up
barriers for a long time. Their family life wa slacking as most men neeeded to work or live in ghettos as divorces became rampant. If a
black man wasn't owning the business, then Black workers were wages were still low. Despite the negative climate, Black people defined 
the era as the Jazz Age as Jazz grew popular along with blues and soul. The Harlem Renaissance provided an outlet for identity and 
freedom. Black literature expressed racial pride and unity such as Langston Hughes. Dances, pottery, painting created vivid images and 
alowed blacks to join as one.

As sexuality came out openly, Homosexuals believed they too can openly surface. They moved to cheap rent places in big cities to
to express alternative lifestyles. They actively attended dance halls. They catered to speakeasies. They worked in cafes and constantly
gathered together to show their freedom. Unforutnately, gay locations were targets for police raids. SOciety would still not allow
homosexuals to be open as discrimination existed outside their bubbles. They would not expect acceptance for decades to come. New
values may exist, but old values tend to stay strong.

Social change was abundant in the 1920s, but it rarely proceded slowly. Technology was both loved and detests. Sexuality was more open
yet censored. Minorites gained more opportunities yet were discriminated against. Eropean women were still restricted despite gaining
the right to vote. They still practiced their freedom in other ways such a divorces and consumerism. African American has a fear
of violence and poverty, but many found ways to gain money and express their individuality through art. Homosexuals were still
shunned by society, but they found jobs and gatherings. Change is gradual and conflicating, but all of it was impactful.
